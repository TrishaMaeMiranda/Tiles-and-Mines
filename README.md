Mechanics 1: Understand the principles behind Tiles and Mines. Each Tiles and Mines game starts out with a grid of unmarked squares. After clicking one of these squares, some of the squares will disappear, some will remain blank, and some will have numbers on them. It's your job to use numbers to figure out which of the blank squares have mines and which are safe to click.
